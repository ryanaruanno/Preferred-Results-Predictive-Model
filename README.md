**Preferred Results Predictive Models (Work In Progress)**

**_Please fork this repository into your own repository before running the code._**

This project determines to classify pitches as perferred results: either a swinging strike, called strike, or induced weak contact.

- The all_raw_uncleaned_pitches.csv file contains all of the raw data used for this project.
- The stats (2).csv file contains batter data used for this project.
- The cleaned_data. feather file contains all of the cleaned data used for the machine learning models.
- The data_cleaning.ipynb file contains the code used to clean all of the raw data used for this project.
- The machine_learning.ipynb file contains the code used to classify and predict samples based through a neural network model and a random forest model.
